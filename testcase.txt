This file is written to show you how to test our proxy.

First you have to change your network setting, using manual proxy configuration.
The proxy name is the VM you are using, the port is 12345.

Then To run the program, type "sudo docker-compose up" in your VM's terminal. 
The browser we used for testing is Chrome. Maybe the browser cache is needed to be 
Cleared before testing.


Test results can be reviewed in proxy.log.

1. testing for normal cases
Test GET:
http://scratchpads.eu/
http://www.rabihyounes.com/
http://home.sina.com/

Test CONNECT:
https://www.baidu.com/
https://google.com/

Test POST:
http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/futurestudents/search_form?SearchableText=
You can type something in this advanced search form to search. Results will be returned normally. 

Larger ones:
http://www.sohu.com/ (it will take a while when you first open it!)
https://www.youtube.com/

2. Test the cache

Run command:
$ echo -ne "GET  /awesome.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: rabihyounes.com\r\n\Cache-Control:max-age=10\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 12345
You can see the picture we GET from this website and you can see "not in cache" and expire time in the proxy_log.
If run the command again, you can see "in cache, valid" in the proxy_log.


Refresh the http://www.rabihyounes.com/, you will find it take shorter time to load
This website. If you check the proxy.log, you will find the cache record.

 
3. Test expire and re-validation

Go to http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/futurestudents/ and refresh the page many times
Since the pictures on this page will change, so this page needs revalidation (max-age=0)
for every response. You can see the record of revalidation in proxy.log
